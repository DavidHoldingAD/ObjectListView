/*
 * TreeListView - A listview that can show a tree of objects in a column
 *
 * Author: Phillip Piper
 * Date: 23/09/2008 11:15 AM
 * 
 * Change log:
 * v2.9
 * 2015-08-02  JPP  - Fixed buy with hierarchical checkboxes where setting the checkedness of a deeply
 *                    nested object would sometimes not correctly calculate the changes in the hierarchy. SF #150.
 * 2015-06-27  JPP  - Corrected small UI glitch when focus was lost and HideSelection was false. SF #135.
 * v2.8.1
 * 2014-11-28  JPP  - Fixed issue in RefreshObject() where a model with less children than previous that could not
 *                    longer be expanded would cause an exception.
 * 2014-11-23  JPP  - Fixed an issue where collapsing a branch could leave the internal object->index map out of date.
 * v2.8
 * 2014-10-08  JPP  - Fixed an issue where pre-expanded branches would not initially expand properly
 * 2014-09-29  JPP  - Fixed issue where RefreshObject() on a root object could cause exceptions
 *                  - Fixed issue where CollapseAll() while filtering could cause exception
 * 2014-03-09  JPP  - Fixed issue where removing a branches only child and then calling RefreshObject()
 *                    could throw an exception.
 * v2.7
 * 2014-02-23  JPP  - Added Reveal() method to show a deeply nested models.
 * 2014-02-05  JPP  - Fix issue where refreshing a non-root item would collapse all expanded children of that item
 * 2014-02-01  JPP  - ClearObjects() now actually, you know, clears objects :)
 *                  - Corrected issue where Expanded event was being raised twice.
 *                  - RebuildChildren() no longer checks if CanExpand is true before rebuilding.
 * 2014-01-16  JPP  - Corrected an off-by-1 error in hit detection, which meant that clicking in the last 16 pixels
 *                    of an items label was being ignored.
 * 2013-11-20  JPP  - Moved event triggers into Collapse() and Expand() so that the events are always triggered.
 *                  - CheckedObjects now includes objects that are in a branch that is currently collapsed
 *                  - CollapseAll() and ExpandAll() now trigger cancellable events
 * 2013-09-29  JPP  - Added TreeFactory to allow the underlying Tree to be replaced by another implementation.
 * 2013-09-23  JPP  - Fixed long standing issue where RefreshObject() would not work on root objects
 *                    which overrode Equals()/GetHashCode().
 * 2013-02-23  JPP  - Added HierarchicalCheckboxes. When this is true, the checkedness of a parent
 *                    is an synopsis of the checkedness of its children. When all children are checked,
 *                    the parent is checked. When all children are unchecked, the parent is unchecked.
 *                    If some children are checked and some are not, the parent is indeterminate.
 * v2.6
 * 2012-10-25  JPP  - Circumvent annoying issue in ListView control where changing
 *                    selection would leave artifacts on the control.
 * 2012-08-10  JPP  - Don't trigger selection changed events during expands
 * 
 * v2.5.1
 * 2012-04-30  JPP  - Fixed issue where CheckedObjects would return model objects that had been filtered out.
 *                  - Allow any column to render the tree, not just column 0 (still not sure about this one)
 * v2.5.0
 * 2011-04-20  JPP  - Added ExpandedObjects property and RebuildAll() method.
 * 2011-04-09  JPP  - Added Expanding, Collapsing, Expanded and Collapsed events.
 *                    The ..ing events are cancellable. These are only fired in response
 *                    to user actions.
 * v2.4.1
 * 2010-06-15  JPP  - Fixed issue in Tree.RemoveObjects() which resulted in removed objects
 *                    being reported as still existing.
 * v2.3
 * 2009-09-01  JPP  - Fixed off-by-one error that was messing up hit detection
 * 2009-08-27  JPP  - Fixed issue when dragging a node from one place to another in the tree
 * v2.2.1
 * 2009-07-14  JPP  - Clicks to the left of the expander in tree cells are now ignored.
 * v2.2
 * 2009-05-12  JPP  - Added tree traverse operations: GetParent and GetChildren.
 *                  - Added DiscardAllState() to completely reset the TreeListView.
 * 2009-05-10  JPP  - Removed all unsafe code
 * 2009-05-09  JPP  - Fixed issue where any command (Expand/Collapse/Refresh) on a model
 *                    object that was once visible but that is currently in a collapsed branch
 *                    would cause the control to crash.
 * 2009-05-07  JPP  - Fixed issue where RefreshObjects() would fail when none of the given
 *                    objects were present/visible.
 * 2009-04-20  JPP  - Fixed issue where calling Expand() on an already expanded branch confused
 *                    the display of the children (SF#2499313)
 * 2009-03-06  JPP  - Calculate edit rectangle on column 0 more accurately
 * v2.1
 * 2009-02-24  JPP  - All commands now work when the list is empty (SF #2631054)
 *                  - TreeListViews can now be printed with ListViewPrinter
 * 2009-01-27  JPP  - Changed to use new Renderer and HitTest scheme
 * 2009-01-22  JPP  - Added RevealAfterExpand property. If this is true (the default),
 *                    after expanding a branch, the control scrolls to reveal as much of the
 *                    expanded branch as possible.
 * 2009-01-13  JPP  - Changed TreeRenderer to work with visual styles are disabled
 * v2.0.1
 * 2009-01-07  JPP  - Made all public and protected methods virtual 
 *                  - Changed some classes from 'internal' to 'protected' so that they
 *                    can be accessed by subclasses of TreeListView.
 * 2008-12-22  JPP  - Added UseWaitCursorWhenExpanding property
 *                  - Made TreeRenderer public so that it can be subclassed
 *                  - Added LinePen property to TreeRenderer to allow the connection drawing 
 *                    pen to be changed 
 *                  - Fixed some rendering issues where the text highlight rect was miscalculated
 *                  - Fixed connection line problem when there is only a single root
 * v2.0
 * 2008-12-10  JPP  - Expand/collapse with mouse now works when there is no SmallImageList.
 * 2008-12-01  JPP  - Search-by-typing now works.
 * 2008-11-26  JPP  - Corrected calculation of expand/collapse icon (SF#2338819)
 *                  - Fixed ugliness with dotted lines in renderer (SF#2332889)
 *                  - Fixed problem with custom selection colors (SF#2338805)
 * 2008-11-19  JPP  - Expand/collapse now preserve the selection -- more or less :)
 *                  - Overrode RefreshObjects() to rebuild the given objects and their children
 * 2008-11-05  JPP  - Added ExpandAll() and CollapseAll() commands
 *                  - CanExpand is no longer cached
 *                  - Renamed InitialBranches to RootModels since it deals with model objects
 * 2008-09-23  JPP  Initial version
